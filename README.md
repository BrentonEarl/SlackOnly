# Welcome to the SlackOnly software repository!

(This is the $ARCH Slackware $RELEASE directory)

## Introduction

SlackOnly is a third party software repository for Slackware Linux that
provides binary packages built from SlackBuilds.org (SBo) build scripts.
The goal is to enable users to install any package from SBo and to do so
with just a quick download.  SlackOnly also provides meta date that
supports automatic dependency resolution with certain package managers.
SlackOnly assumes that users have installed a full installation of
Slackware Linux prior to use.

SlackOnly supports the following Slackware releases and architectures:

 * Slackware 14.1 32 bit [1]
 * Slackware 14.1 64 bit [2]
 * Slackware-current 32 bit [3]
 * Slackware-current 64 bit [4]
 * Custom Packages 64 bit [5]

## Why should you use SlackOnly?

 * To quickly test a program before building it from source
 * Your computer is too slow or old to build a piece of software from
   source in a timely fashion
 * You are not worried about customizing every package and default
   package configurations are adequte
 * Some packages have a massive dependency chain and building it can be
   very complicated and time consuming

There are a variety of ways to enable and use SlackOnly on your
Slackware installation.

 * Install the slackpkg+
